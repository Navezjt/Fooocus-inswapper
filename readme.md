# Fooocus-inswapper

This is a fork of [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus).  This fork integrates the popular Insightface/[inswapper](https://github.com/haofanwang/inswapper) library used by roop, ReActor, and others.  The goal of this repository is to stay up-to-date with the main repository, while also maintaining the inswapper integration.

For more detailed and official documentation, please refer to [lllyasviel's repository](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus).

A standalone installation does not exist for this repository.
